This application is a cadet tracker that allows one to add and remove cadets, search cadets by various criterion, see their completed objectives, and attendance record
Multiple Cadets can have the same name, but every cadet's AS # should be unique, and in the format "AS123". 
A Cadet's classification could be one of four choices, IMT, FTP, ICL, or SCL.
A Cadet's flight designation could be one of three choices, Alpha, Beta, or Gamma.
The application will tell you if something you enterded was incorrect, and will tell you which of the options was in the wrong format, or was not one of the choices.
The program will aslo tell you if you try to enter a duplicate AS #, and will let you know it already belongs to a cadet
